            Take it Away was created on the idea that "One man's trash is another man's treasure." -English Proverb<br />
            This is not a charitable website; however, people are able to get rid of furniture they no longer have use for while helping someone else in need.<br />
            Take it Away makes it easy and convenient for both the donor and the recipient because there are no fees involved!<br />
